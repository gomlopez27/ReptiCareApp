# ReptiCareApp

This app requires an active REST server and its information can be found at:  https://github.com/AndreOA/ReptiCare .

## How to change the server address
Since the app requires an active REST server, you must have your server address in the project. To do so,  you must manually change the server address by inputting it in the ``server_url `` tag, found at `` res/values/strings.xml``.
